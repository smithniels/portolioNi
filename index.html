                  <p>The <i>Daily Danish</i> app is working! I was stuck for a minute trying to figure out how to get PyInstaller to update the executable file the python is in after I'd added more words to the Translations.csv. Low and behold, the EXE updates on save... Anyway things are working. üò¨üëç</p>

                  <p>Alright, I forgot how much I liked working with Python.</p>
                  <p>
                     I put together an automated email sender for sending daily Danish translations. I've been trying to jot down Danish words as I come across them to look up their translations later. 
                     I set up Crontab to execute the Python code daily randomly selecting a translation from my Translation.CSV file.

                     Alright, I'm going to attempt to relearn Python! It's been a minute, but I think it'll be "Fun" at some point...

                  <p>
                     Working on fixing up this new site. I've been a bit
                     busy the last year with my move(escape) from America, but I have some
                     free time, so I'll try to make this into a decent site. The main
                     problem there is that I've done almost zero non-SQL coding in
                     ages, so this will be a "Fun" project!
                  </p>
